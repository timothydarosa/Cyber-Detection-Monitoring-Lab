# Setting up a Cybersecurity Homelab for Intrusion Detection and Monitoring  
## _**What you should expect**_

This walkthrough will equip you with practical skills to build a cybersecurity homelab. Building a Cybersecurity home lab utilizing VMware and pfSense for secure network simulations, apply Security Onion for threat detection, and prepare Kali Linux for attack simulations. You'll also gain experience in configuring Windows systems and using Splunk, as well as integrating various Linux machines for diverse cybersecurity scenarios. I will be following along with cyberwox and cybermentor's walkthroughs for this homelab. We also used domain controllers and Active Directory.

## **Requirements for Host Desktop**

For this module, you'll need a computer with a _**minimum of 16GB of RAM**_ to effectively run multiple virtual machines simultaneously. Sufficient RAM and Decent CPU will suffice. Also, ensure you have ample storage space for the software installations and data generated during the lab activities. Having a reliable internet connection is beneficial for accessing online resources and updates. Prior knowledge of basic network and system operations is recommended, but not mandatory. Please note that the specifications may vary depending on the complexity of the scenarios you wish to simulate in your homelab.

It's important to use a separate setup for your lab, one that doesn't hold any critical data like personal files or sensitive information. This setup will serve as your experimental playground. But I will be doing it on my main host computer if you're wondering.

## **Setting up VMware Workstation as Hypervisor**

Virtual machines can be thought of as individual computers housed within your own computer. They are indispensable in the realm of cybersecurity, providing a safe space for testing and experimentation, thereby shielding your main system from potential harm.

For this walkthrough, we will primarily be using VMware on Windows.

**Download VMware:** Get the Free VMware Workstation from their website

1.  Navigate to the [VMware Download Center](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads).
    
2.  Locate **VMware Workstation Player** under Desktop & End user Computing.
    
3.  Select the installer from the list according to your host operating system.
    
4.  Click **Download**.
    

**Run Installer:** > **Follow Steps:** > **Agree to License:**  > **Select Typical Setup:**  > **Choose Preferences:**  > **Install:**  > **Open VMware:** 

## **Configuring pfSense Firewall for Network Segmentation and Security**

In our cybersecurity homelab, we rely on pfSense, an open-source firewall and router software. Its first crucial function is network segmentation, which separates our virtual machines into different network zones, mirroring a realistic network scenario. Secondly, pfSense enhances our lab's security by inspecting network traffic and blocking any potential threats, safeguarding our learning environment. Furthermore, the hands-on experience we acquire in managing network security through pfSense is invaluable for any cybersecurity practitioner. Overall, in this lab, pfSense will be an integral tool, assisting in effectively managing and securing our virtual network.
   
**Download pfSense:** Since pfSense doesn't offer ISO files directly anymore, I download the iso file from Dakota State University's repo.

## **Setting up Security Onion as a Comprehensive IDS, Security Monitoring, and Log Management Solution**

In our cybersecurity homelab, we implement Security Onion, a powerful open-source software designed for **network security monitoring, intrusion detection, and log management**. An integral component of any robust cybersecurity setup, Security Onion serves as our comprehensive Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This means it constantly monitors our network traffic, raising alerts when it detects potential threats. But it goes beyond simply detecting threats. It provides us with sophisticated tools that enable in-depth investigation into these potential security breaches, offering invaluable insights to mitigate future risks. Additionally, Security Onion assists us in efficiently managing system logs - a critical part of incident response, as these logs record the events happening on our virtual machines. By integrating Security Onion into our lab, we not only enhance our ability to detect and investigate potential threats but also gain a practical understanding of how professional cybersecurity systems function.

**Download Security Onion:** Visit the Security Onion website and download the latest version.

## **Preparing Kali Linux for Attack Simulations**

Kali Linux is a specialized Linux distribution, specifically tailored for digital forensics and penetration testing. It's a fundamental tool in our cybersecurity lab due to its capacity for simulating various types of cyber attacks. Loaded with numerous security tools, Kali Linux enables us to emulate real-world attacks on our virtual network. This process is not only eye-opening, revealing how such attacks transpire and how to thwart them, but also equips us with the practical experience of using professional cybersecurity tools. Most importantly, all of this is conducted within the confines of our controlled lab environment, eliminating any risk to actual systems or breaching legal boundaries. In short, by preparing Kali Linux for attack simulations in this lab, we are paving a crucial path for hands-on learning in cybersecurity.

**Download Kali Linux:** Visit the Kali Linux website and download the latest version.

1.  [Download Kali Linux here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines). (We can download the Pre-built Virtual Machine)

## **Setting up a Windows Server to Function as a Domain Controller**

A Domain Controller, think of it as the boss of a Windows network, is in charge of all the important stuff like user logins, deciding who gets to access what, and making sure resources are shared correctly. It uses a nifty tool known as Active Directory, which is like the 'phonebook' of the network, keeping a record of all users and computers.

Having a Windows Server as a Domain Controller in our cybersecurity homelab is super valuable. It mirrors what we'd see in a real business setting, letting us learn about managing a network. What's even better is that our lab is a secure environment, so we can experiment and play around with different settings, exploring the ins and outs of cybersecurity without worrying about messing up a real network.

## **Configuring Splunk on Ubuntu Server**

Setting up Splunk within a VMware virtual machine is an important step in creating a cybersecurity environment that's both robust and flexible. Splunk helps analyze large amounts of data, such as security logs, making it a vital tool for security monitoring. By configuring Splunk in VMware, you're creating a controlled space where it can run without affecting other parts of your computer system. This approach allows for more focused monitoring, efficient use of resources, and easier scalability as your needs grow. It's a balanced solution that meets the demands of both novice users and seasoned professionals, providing a streamlined path to enhanced cybersecurity monitoring.

## **Conclusion**

We began by building our Host PC, which served as the foundation for all our operations. We set up VMware Workstation as our Hypervisor, allowing us to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single system.

Next, we configured a pfSense Firewall, a crucial security measure that helped us divide our network into segments and maintain strict security controls over them. Following this, we installed Security Onion, our comprehensive solution for intrusion detection, security monitoring, and log management.

We also prepared Kali Linux, a potent tool designed for conducting penetration testing and security audits. Meanwhile, our Windows Server was established as a Domain Controller, managing user interactions and access to shared resources within our network.

In addition to these, we set up Windows-based desktops and configured Splunk, a platform that enabled us to search, monitor, and analyze machine-generated data from websites, applications, servers, and mobile devices.

Finally, we set up a universal forwarder in splunk. Using a Universal Forwarder in Splunk is crucial for your cybersecurity homelab. It's like a helper that grabs data from different areas of your lab such as firewalls or servers, and sends it to Splunk. This lets you check your network's safety by reviewing the collected data. Using it transforms your homelab into a real-world cybersecurity practice field, aiding you in spotting any suspicious and fixing security problems.
   You can try some additional installations which are optional

## **Optional: Installing ParrotOS**
